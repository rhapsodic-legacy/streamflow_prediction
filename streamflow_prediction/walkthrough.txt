# Flood Prediction Model for Bangladesh (1948–2013) - Copy-Paste Ready

This notebook develops a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for predicting flood events in Bangladesh using a deep learning model trained on the **"65 Years of Weather Data Bangladesh (1948–2013)"** dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes monthly weather variables such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud coverage across multiple stations, with flood events labeled based on region-specific rainfall thresholds (550 mm/month for deltaic regions, 1100 mm/month for coastal regions during monsoon months). 

The model leverages a neural network to achieve high accuracy and perfect flood recall, addressing challenges like class imbalance and rainfall dominance, while highlighting limitations due to missing non-rainfall factors (e.g., upstream runoff, cyclones). Designed for educational purposes, this project demonstrates the process of building, evaluating, and diagnosing a flood prediction model in Google Colab, providing insights into flood modeling in a complex, flood-prone region.

## 1. Setup Environment

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
 (Note! This was not done in .ipynb file due to the dataset being so small.)
```

```python
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn imblearn
```

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
import joblib
```

**Purpose:** Sets up Google Colab environment, mounts Google Drive, installs required libraries, and imports them for data processing, modeling, visualization, and evaluation.

---

## 2. Load and Explore Dataset

```python
data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/65_Years_of_Weather_Data_Bangladesh.csv')
print(data.head())
print(data.info())
print(data['Station Names'].unique())
```

```python
sns.histplot(data['Rainfall'], bins=50)
plt.title('Rainfall Distribution')
plt.show()
```

**Purpose:** Loads the CSV file and performs initial exploration to understand structure, including column types, missing values, and rainfall distribution.

---

## 3. Assign Regions

```python
coastal_stations = ['Teknaf', 'Coxs Bazar', 'Chittagong']
deltaic_stations = ['Barisal', 'Dhaka', 'Faridpur']
data['Region'] = data['Station Names'].apply(lambda x: 'Coastal' if x in coastal_stations else 'Deltaic')
```

```python
sns.boxplot(x='Region', y='Rainfall', hue='Month', data=data[data['Month'].isin([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])])
plt.title('Monsoon Rainfall by Region')
plt.show()
```

**Purpose:** Creates a Region column to classify stations as coastal or deltaic, enabling region-specific flood thresholds. Visualizes rainfall patterns to confirm higher rainfall in coastal areas during monsoon months.

---

## 4. Preprocess Data

```python
# Handle missing values
data = data.fillna(data.mean(numeric_only=True))
```

```python
# Define flood labeling function
def assign_flood(row):
    if row['Month'] in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:
        if row['Region'] == 'Coastal' and row['Rainfall'] >= 1100:
            return 1
        elif row['Region'] == 'Deltaic' and row['Rainfall'] >= 550:
            return 1
    return 0

data['Flood'] = data.apply(assign_flood, axis=1)
```

```python
# Check flood distribution
print(data['Flood'].value_counts())
sns.countplot(x='Flood', data=data)
plt.title('Flood vs. Non-Flood Events')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Select features
features = ['Max Temp', 'Min Temp', 'Rainfall', 'Relative Humidity', 'Wind Speed', 
            'Cloud Coverage', 'Bright Sunshine', 'Month', 'Region']
X = data[features]
y = data['Flood']
```

```python
# Encode categorical variables
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=['Region'], drop_first=True)
```

```python
# Scale numerical features
numerical_features = ['Max Temp', 'Min Temp', 'Rainfall', 'Relative Humidity', 
                      'Wind Speed', 'Cloud Coverage', 'Bright Sunshine', 'Month']
scaler = StandardScaler()
X[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(X[numerical_features])
```

```python
# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=42, stratify=y)
```

**Purpose:** Preprocesses data by handling missing values, creating flood labels based on regional thresholds, selecting features, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset.

---

## 5. Build and Train Neural Network

```python
# Define model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

```python
# Calculate class weights for imbalanced data
class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y_train), y=y_train)
class_weight_dict = dict(enumerate(class_weights))
```

```python
# Compile and train model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, 
                   validation_split=0.2, class_weight=class_weight_dict, verbose=1)
```

**Purpose:** Defines and trains a neural network with three hidden layers, using class weights to address imbalance and dropout for regularization.

---

## 6. Evaluate Model

```python
# Make predictions with custom threshold
y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.7).astype(int)
```

```python
# Print classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

```python
# Visualize confusion matrix
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()
```

**Purpose:** Evaluates the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization with an optimized threshold of 0.7.

## 7. Diagnostics

### Feature Importance Analysis

```python
# Random Forest for feature importance
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, class_weight='balanced')
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
feature_importances = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train.columns,
    'Importance': rf.feature_importances_
}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)

print("Feature Importances:\n", feature_importances)
```

plt.title('Feature Importances')
plt.show()
```

```python
# Analyze false positives
y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.7).astype(int).flatten()
false_positives = X_test[(y_pred == 1) & (y_test == 0)]
false_positives_data = pd.DataFrame(
    scaler.inverse_transform(X_test[(y_pred == 1) & (y_test == 0)][numerical_features]),
    columns=numerical_features
)

print("False Positives Description:\n", false_positives_data.describe())
```

```python
# Visualize rainfall in false positives
sns.histplot(false_positives_data['Rainfall'], bins=20)
plt.title('Rainfall in False Positives')
plt.show()
```

### Threshold Optimization

```python
# Test different thresholds
y_pred_proba = model.predict(X_test)
thresholds = [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]
for thresh in thresholds:
    y_pred = (y_pred_proba > thresh).astype(int)
    print(f"\nThreshold: {thresh}")
    print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Cross-Validation

```python
# Cross-validation with Logistic Regression
lr = LogisticRegression(class_weight='balanced', random_state=42)
scores = cross_val_score(lr, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_weighted')
print(f"Cross-Validation F1 Scores: {scores}")

plt.hist(y_pred_proba[y_test == 1], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Flood')
plt.axvline(0.7, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Threshold')
plt.title('Predicted Probabilities by Class')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Probability')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Purpose:** Comprehensive diagnostics including feature importance, false positive analysis, threshold optimization, cross-validation, and probability distribution visualization.

## Model Limitations and Improvement Potential

The MVP performs well (99% accuracy, 100% flood recall, 91% flood precision at threshold 0.7), but its reliance on rainfall (66% importance) limits capturing 10–20% of flood causation from unmeasured factors like upstream runoff from India, cyclone storm surges, embankment failures, or urban drainage issues. 

**Critical Lesson:** No model, however complex, can predict phenomena absent from the data. For example, a flood from an embankment breach at 300 mm/month or a cyclone's surge (e.g., Cyclone Sidr 2007) will be missed, as the CSV lacks river flow, pressure, or infrastructure data.

### Marginal Improvements (~2–5% precision gain):

#### Feature Engineering
```python
# Add lagged rainfall
data['Prev_Rainfall'] = data.groupby('Station Names')['Rainfall'].shift(1).fillna(0)

# Add cumulative monsoon rainfall
data['Cumulative_Monsoon'] = data[data['Month'].isin([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])].groupby(['Station Names', 'YEAR'])['Rainfall'].cumsum().fillna(0)
```

#### Alternative Models
```python
# Random Forest for better precision
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, class_weight='balanced', random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Adapting to Other Regions (e.g., Canada)

To adapt to Canada, where floods are driven by snowmelt, students must re-evaluate flood mechanisms and data:

### Key Changes Required:
- **Flood Drivers:** Spring snowmelt depends on temperature, snowpack, and soil saturation
- **Data Requirements:** Include snow water equivalent (SWE), daily temperature, precipitation
- **Labeling:** Define floods using river level thresholds or historical records
- **Feature Engineering:**

```python
# Example for snowmelt regions
data['Degree_Days'] = data['Max Temp'].clip(lower=0).cumsum()
```

### Data Sources:
- Environment Canada
- NASA SNODAS
- USGS gauges
- Canadian Disaster Database

## Key Lessons for University Coders

1. **Data Understanding:** Dataset limits cap predictive power - analyze data to recognize measurable vs. unmeasurable factors
2. **Model Simplicity:** Simple neural networks can leverage dominant patterns effectively
3. **Imbalance Handling:** Class weights address minority class challenges
4. **Diagnostics:** Feature importance and error analysis guide improvements
5. **Regional Adaptation:** Different regions require new data and labeling approaches

---

## Conclusion

This MVP demonstrates a complete flood prediction pipeline, achieving strong performance but limited by rainfall reliance and unmeasured factors. Students learn to build, evaluate, and diagnose models while understanding data constraints: some floods are unpredictable without external data. Marginal improvements are possible within the dataset, but major gains require new data sources. Adapting to regions like Canada involves redefining flood drivers - a valuable exercise in applying machine learning to diverse problems.
